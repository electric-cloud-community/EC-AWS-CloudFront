  Amazon CloudFront is a fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data,
  videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency, high transfer speeds,

  AWS global infrastructure, as well as other AWS services. CloudFront works seamlessly with services
  including AWS Shield for DDoS mitigation, Amazon S3, Elastic Load Balancing or Amazon EC2 as origins for your
  applications, and Lambda@Edge to run custom code closer to customers’ users and to customize the user experience.
